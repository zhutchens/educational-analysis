# Educational Analysis Project 
First project in Intro to Data Mining course (ITCS 3162). I go through the process of obtaining data, preprocessing, and creating visualizations to answer my questions about it. The main question I had regarding the dataset is 'How can we use student demographical information to identify students who may benefit from extra support in the classroom?". You can find my full analysis on my website at: https://zhutchens.github.io/projects/project1.html
