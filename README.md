## Educational Analysis Project 
First project in Intro to Data Mining course (ITCS 3162). I go through the process of obtaining data, preprocessing, and creating visualizations to answer my questions about it. The main question I had regarding the dataset is 'How can we use student demographical information to identify students who may benefit from extra support in the classroom?"

# Dataset
